The UK Road Accidents Data Analysis Project aims to analyze extensive traffic accident data to identify key factors impacting road safety. By examining trends in variables like road types, light conditions, and weather, the study provides insights to support policy decisions and enhance road safety.

### *Tools used - MS Excel, Power BI, Tableau, SQL*

# Introduction
The purpose of the UK Road Accidents Analysis Project is to analyse large amounts of traffic accident data in order to identify the key factors contributing to road safety issues. This study searches for trends and patterns in variables such as road kinds, light conditions, and weather. Providing helpful information to support policy decisions and increase road safety is the aim.
# Objectives
1. **Identify Key Factors:** Analyze the impact of various factors such as weather conditions, light conditions, road types, and speed limits on road accident severity.
2. **Temporal Analysis:** Examine the distribution of road accidents over different days of the week and specific times of the day to identify peak accident periods.
3. **Spatial Analysis:** Investigate the geographical distribution of accidents by local authority districts to identify high-risk areas.
4. **Casualty and Vehicle Analysis:** Assess the relationship between the number of vehicles involved and the number of casualties to understand accident dynamics.
5. **Junction Analysis:** Explore how junction details and control types influence the frequency and severity of accidents.
6. **Road Surface and Carriageway Hazards:** Examine the effects of road surface conditions and carriageway hazards on accident occurrences.
7. **Policy Recommendations:** Provide actionable insights and recommendations for policymakers to improve road safety and reduce accident rates

These objectives comprehensively cover the analysis of different factors related to road accidents, providing a solid foundation for the project.

# Data Collection

## Source

The data for this project was sourced from publicly available UK road accident records, provided by the UK Government. This dataset encompasses detailed information about road accidents, including specifics about the location, timing, conditions, and severity of each accident.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of 3,07,973 records from 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2022, includes various features capturing different aspects of road accidents. 
This comprehensive dataset enables a thorough analysis of the factors contributing to road accidents across the UK.

# Data Cleaning and Processing

Identified and handled the missing data and duplicate values using tools like power query.

# Data Visualizationa and Analysis

Created charts and graphs for KPIs and built interactive dashaboards in MS Excel, MS Power BI and Tableau. Also ran queries using SQL server.
